# SBA316
### Landscaping Company Website
## Example of a single page website
# This website was made using the languages of, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used the MDN, W3schools, and GeeksforGeeks as sources of information to learn how to use some of the techniques needed for this SBA 316 DOM assignment. Some difficulty I experienced while completing this project was creating the READme using markdown language, after many tutorials, there's still so much to learn.   This project includes forms, images, GIF's, buttons, a hyperlink and various other additions to make this project complete. Thank you for checking out this website project.
